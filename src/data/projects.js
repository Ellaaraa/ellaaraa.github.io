    description: "Evaluated LLMs for generating code patches at the repository level using FEABench, a benchmark dataset from Microsoft Research. Compared multiple model configurations (baseline and documenter-augmented approaches) using multiple evaluation methods: similarity metrics (line similarity, sequence similarity, file overlap), LLM-as-a-judge assessment, and unit test pass rates. Developed evaluation pipelines to analyze how repository context affects code generation performance across different model architectures.",
